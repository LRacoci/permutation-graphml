       To test Deepmind's Graph Nets framework against invariance with respect 
       to permutations in graphs representation, we used three different problems 
       in at least four different contexts: with permuted and non-permuted training 
       sets; and permuted and non-permuted testing sets.
       In all these contexts, the common behavior was that permuting testing 
       sets reduced the accuracy of the networks and permuting training sets produced 
       better results. This supports the argument that the algorithms might not 
       be learning from the graph structure itself, but from the graph's 
       computational representation.
