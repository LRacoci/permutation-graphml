\begin{abstract}
Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making.
This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning.
However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under
much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches.
In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences---a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy---remains a formidable challenge for modern AI.
